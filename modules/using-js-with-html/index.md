# Using JavaScript with HTML

JavaScript is a programming language that is used to change a website after the site has **rendered**. JavaScript is most often used to *respond to user actions*. This is called making a site **interactive**. Besides responding user action, JavaScript can also create and modify the DOM (HTML elements).

Let's review the three programming languages that browsers understand:

 - HTML: the **content** of the page
 - CSS: **styles** the content
 - JavaScript: interaction and DOM updates
