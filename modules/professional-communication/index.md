# Professional Communication
Encourage students to use Slack as a tool to create community and connection, and as a resource when needing help. Strongly encourage students not to wait when they are stuck on something. They need to ask on Slack and get the answer right away, because they are expected to get stuck at least 100 times each sprint, so they need to develop the skills to get unstuck. Explain the difference between getting unblocked “on your own” (without help) and taking the initiative to get unblocked. 

Introduce Stack Overflow as a place to ask questions, and talk about the perfect question, warn students not to try to ask the perfect question on Slack.
