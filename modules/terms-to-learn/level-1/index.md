# Terms to Learn -- Level 1

## Commit
A commit is a version/snapshot of your code created in your local repo. Every commit has a unique ID associated that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.

## diff
A diff is the comparison of two input data sets highlighting the changes between them. 

## git
Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. Once installed, Git can be initialized on a project to create a Git repository

## GitHub Desktop
Github Desktop is an application that allows you to manage your Github projects on your local machine.

## Github Pages
Github pages is a way to host your website directly from your GitHub repository. We can use this method to quickly host websites because we don't need to setup and maintain our own servers.

## GitHub website
Github.com is a site that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. 
We use github.com to store, manage, and host our projects.

## localhost
The default name describing the local computer address

## Pull Request (PR)
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

## Repository
*Also referred to as a repo*
A git repository is the file location where you are storing all the files related to your project.

## Staging
Staging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit in git is performed in two steps: staging and pushing the commit. 

## Working Directory
*Alternatively referred to as the current directory or current working directory (CWD)*
The directory or folder in which you are currently working.
