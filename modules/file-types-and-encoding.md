# File types and encoding
This section is an introduction to some of the necessary logistics of coding. Students should understand that code is stored in files, that different programs are able to decipher different types of code or encoding, and that it is possible for humans to write code using special plaintext editors.

## Topics
### File types
Talk about different file types as a way of showing that there are many ways to format a document, and HTML/CSS are just one way. 

## Exercise
Demonstrate that handwritten code needs to be edited in plaintext, in a special editor (not MS Word), and given a special extension. HTML files can be opened by either a browser or an editor. The same exact document can be encoded in different formats. 

Using Atom, open a HTML file, a Word document, and a PDF. How do each of these files look when opened in a plaintext editor?
