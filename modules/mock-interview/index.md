# Mock Interview
Students can practice telling their “developer story” which they wrote as part of the homew rok out loud. This should be done in groups of 4: 2 TAs and 2 students. TAs should give feedback encouraging loudness, clarity, and point out any other important communication impediments that might be an issue in a job interview. TA can also practice asking clarifying questions from students resumes.
