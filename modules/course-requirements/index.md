# Course Requirements
There are a few things that need to be completed before starting the course. This includes:
* Introducing the teacher, the structure of the class, the times, durations, etc. 
* Account management and password management workshop
* Slack as the universal point of communication. Importance of checking in with slack constantly to receive and give support. 
* Matching with a tutor and scheduling meeting time during the week.

## File Management
It is very important to be organized and consistent with where files are placed and how they are named. Students absolutely need to be familiar with how their computerâ€™s file explorer works (either Finder or Explorer). Students need to be aware of where they are saving files whenever they are saving a file and need to be able to find it in their file explorer.
