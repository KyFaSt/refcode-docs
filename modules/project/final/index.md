# Final Project
The final project is built upon the [minimum viable product version](../mvp). After completing the MVP, students will continue working on and refining their websites, add styling, photos, custom content, and other personalizations.

To graduate the class, students must have completed the MVP (listed above) as well as all of the following:

- Website should be live and accessible on student’s domain
- Website codebase should also be visible publicly on GitHub.com
- Website should have a consistent design and layout.
- Website should not have any broken or “under construction” sections.
- Website should demonstrate that the student has learned more than was taught in class and has solved problems on their own.
