# Minimum Viable Product Details
Half way through the class, you will need to complete at least a rough version of your final site. This will be a website that meets a minimum set of requirements but is still in need of additional work and refinement - this is also known as a **minimum viable product**.

A **minimum viable product (MVP)** is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development. When developing new products, we use the concept of minimum viable product to limit scope and define the steps needed for success.

Your MVP must be published on the internet and the source code must be available through GitHub. 

Your website MVP must have all of the following:

### Homepage
- Will have an introductory paragraph.
- Will have an image of you.

### About Me / My Story / Developer Story
- Should have your developer story.
- Should have an image of you.
- Should have a link to each of the following:
- - Your GitHub repository.
- - Your LinkedIn profile.

### Links page
- Should have a link to each of your classmateâ€™s websites.
- Resume page
- Should contain your resume.

### Every page will have the following common items:
- Common header
- Common footer
- Common navigation (containing links to all pages on your site)
- All pages use one common CSS file for styling.
- All changes should be committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
