## Homework

### Exercises
1. Make sure you have a profile photo in Slack. If you don’t have one, look in the #random channel for instructions on how to get one. (2-5 minutes)
1. Post a screenshot of your computer to Slack. If you don’t know how to do this, you can look through previous slack comments to find instructions, or ask for help! (2 minutes)
Use your keyboard to perform a swapkown on your GYRT. (10 Seconds)
1. Brainload Syntax Game
Play the “Brainload” javascript game for 10 minutes. (10 mins)

### Project
1. Register a domain name
Follow the instructions in this document to register a domain for free.

1. Create your website project folder
 - Before you create your first file, you need to create a new folder to put everything in so you don’t lose it. In your Documents folder, create a new folder named “Refcode Project”.

1. Create your website home page
 - In Atom, create a file named index.html. Make sure it’s inside the “Refcode Project” folder.
 - Type the name of your domain (similar to how x.com did).

1. Create your website “developer story” page
 - Use Atom to create a file named mystory.html. Make sure it’s inside the “Refcode Project” folder.
 - Copy your developer story outline (from the shared Google Doc here).
 - Paste your developer story into the mystory.html file in Atom.
 - Consider if there are any major milestones missing from the list you put together.
 - Use HTML to turn your developer story milestones into a list (use the `<ol>` and `<li>` tags).
 - Use HTML to continue building your developer story page. It will need a heading and a paragraph to introduce yourself and to introduce the developer story. Feel free to add anything else you are learning about HTML

### Watch YouTube Video

### GitHub (optional)
1. Go to the GitHub Refcode repository website. (1 minute)
 - https://github.com/brentonstrine/Refcode
1. On that page, click “Clone or Download” and then “Download ZIP” (1 minute)
1. This will download the Refcode repository as a .zip file
 - Hint: Where did you download it?
1. Decompress it somewhere. Where did you decompress it? (1 minute)
1. Open Atom and add the Refcode folder as a project.  (5 minute)

### Self Learning
1.  Spend some time learning on your own. You can use Google or YouTube or anything else that will help you learn. You can pick what you would like to learn about: HTML, CSS or Javascript. You may choose to begin a tutorial on CodeCademy, this is a good one:

### Resources
#### Here is a list of resources you may find interesting.
Some important HTML elements:

|Tag|		Semantic Meaning|
|---|---|

#### /r/LEARNPROGRAMMING Subreddit
Reddit is a website that allows small communities to form on any topic. The /r/learnprogramming community is a great place to ask questions and see what other beginners are going through.

#### Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is a website for asking technical questions about computers, code, and developer tools. You may wish to create an account and begin asking some questions and earning points. It would be a good goal to get to 15 points by the end of this course.
