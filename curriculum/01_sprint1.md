# Sprint 1 Overview
Broad and shallow introduction to almost everything that will be taught in the class.

## Things necessary for the class
* Introducing the teacher, the structure of the class, the times, durations, etc. 
* Account management and password management workshop (should be a prerequisite for 2019)
* Slack as the universal point of communication. Importance of checking in with slack constantly to receive and give support. 
* Matching with a tutor and scheduling meeting time during the week.

## Files, encoding, and code
This section is an introduction to some of the necessary logistics of coding. Students should understand that code is stored in files, that different programs are able to decipher different types of code or encoding, and that it is possible for humans to write code using special plaintext editors.

### File Management (prerequisite)
It is very important to be organized and consistent with where files are placed and how they are named. Students absolutely need to be familiar with how their computerâ€™s file explorer works (either Finder or Explorer). Students need to be aware of where they are saving files whenever they are saving a file and need to be able to find it in their file explorer. 

### File types
Talk about different file types as a way of showing that there are many ways to format a document, and HTML/CSS are just one way. Demonstrate that handwritten code needs to be edited in plaintext, in a special editor (not MS Word) and given a special extension. HTML files can be opened by either a browser or an editor. The same exact document can be encoded in different formats. 

### Atom
Atom is a program specifically designed for writing code. It opens documents in plaintext without any other formatting. Thus, if you open files that have some other type of encoding, you will see the code, not the rendered output or rich text. The file extension is a hint about what type of encoding will be used and which program should open it. 

### Taste of HTML
Write a little HTML. Learn to open a file in an editor and a browser simultaneously. Begin to form an understanding that HTML tags affect how text is rendered in the browser. See that random text in HTML is by default not interpreted as code. 

### Taste of CSS
Learn that there are multiple types of coding languages and that they do different things. Different languages have different syntaxes that look very different. Begin to understand that CSS can target specific parts of the HTML to change the way it is rendered. Learn that a page can be edited while open in two places and saved, but that it will need to be refreshed in the browser to see updates. Learn that random text in CSS is by default interpreted as code.

### Taste of Javascript
Learn that websites can be more than just documents, and that Javascript is the language that makes interaction possible. Learn that random text in Javascript is by default interpreted as code, but that Javascript also expects values in certain places. Begin to understand that values are data, and that there are different types of values in Javascript.
