# Sprint 6 Homework

## 1. Send Slack Message
Send a message “Hello, I am starting my homework!” to the `#general` room on Slack.  Remember to ask for help if you are getting stuck.

## 2. Continue to work on your project
1. Make sure you have a header, footer, and navigation across all your pages
1. If you haven't already, post your project site link to the `#project-website-links` channel
1. Make sure your `links.html` page is up-to-date so it has links to other classmate's sites.

### Project requirements
* Style your document using CSS in your `style.css` file.
* Add javascript to your page using the `script` tag to import a `scripts.js` file.

> Remember to ask your Study Group Leads for help! These are tough things, so it's OK to ask for some help.

## 3. Exercises
### Arrow and Target
For this exercise, we are going to try to move an arrow from one side of the page to hit the center of the target on the other.
We are going to use something new for this exercise - CodePen. This will allow you to easily make changes to a small piece of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the browser without using the inspector.

1. Go to the following page [https://codepen.io/kevinglover/pen/gNaxxR](https://codepen.io/kevinglover/pen/gNaxxR)
2. You should see the a page that looks like the following: ![Arrow and Target Screenshot](./06-sprint-homework-1.png)
3. The three panels at the top allow you to change the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the bottom section.
4. Try to update the CSS to get the arrow to hit the target. *What happens if you resize the page?*
5. Notice that changes you make happen automatically. Refreshing the page will reset any changes you made!
6. Now try to make the arrow hit the target by only updating the Javascript section.
7. For an extra challenge, try to make it so the arrow hits the target when you click it!

### CSS Grid
1. Find a poster, billboard, or a magazine spread that you think would look cool.
2. Try to find the grid pattern on display, like below:

Original | With Guidelines
---------|----------------
![Original Yellow Poster](./06-sprint-homework-2.jpg) | ![Yellow Poster with Guidelines](./06-sprint-homework-3.jpg)

> Look for where there are breaks in the horizontal and vertical flow. Do any sections look like a box? That might be a good place to start!

*How would you go about making this using CSS Grid?*
Share your examples with your Study Group, so you can all work together. Maybe they will have some ideas!


## 4. Self Learning
Review some Javascript or CSS Grid topics! Share in your study groups things that you've learned - and feel free to share in class too!
