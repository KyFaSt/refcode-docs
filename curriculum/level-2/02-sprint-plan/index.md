# Sprint 2
HTML structure & semantics, CSS Atomic Design, and Web design

## Making Time to Code

Learning to code is skill similiar to learning an instrument, the only way to improve is with practice! In the last class we talked about a few different strategies which can help you find time to practice coding:

1. Create a detailed schedule and stick to it
1. Code before your other obligations start
1. Try to sneak coding into smaller windows of availability, like lunch breaks

### Review 

* How much time did you spend coding or learning this week?
* Does anyone else struggle with procrastination?
  * [Building habits](https://jamesclear.com/habit-guide) helps to avoid the lure of procastination. 
* Keeping a calendar with all of you events is a great way to find time for coding in a busy schedule. [Carson's calendar]
* Setting goals is another way to be intentional about how you're spending your time.

## Homework Review

### HTML Best Practices

* What are a few HTML best practices? 
* Why is it important to follow HTML best practices? 
* What is "clean code"?

**Exercise 📝**

Find all of the HTML best practice errors on the worksheet. Explain how the error should be fixed and why the error is problematic in the numbered section below. 

### CSS Best Practices

* What are CSS naming conventions? What is a convention???
* What problems are CSS naming conventions trying to solve? 
* What does BEM stand for? 

**Exercise 📝**

Write out class names using BEM for the page elements highlighted in red.

## In-class Assignment 

### Creating Pull Requests
For this assignment we are going to have students create a basic page on their projects repository as a new branch, then open a pull request for their changes. Next, we will pair up into groups where members will comment on each other's code. We will initially perform a code review face-to-face with one assigned reviewer, and then we will break for discussion.

#### Questions for Discussion
* What was helpful in the comment?
* How did you point out things that you wanted to ask about?  
* What suggestions did the reviewer give? 
* Did you agree with everything the reviewer said?

#### Takeaway
When developing on your own, you have total control on what goes into your project and how it is written. The code for your project only has to make sense to you! However, as soon as you have another person look at your code, you have make sure your code makes sense to others too. If your code is not understandable to other developers, then they won't be able to make good comments and help you out, and they also won't want to add your code to their project. Viewed this way, code is a language that everybody needs to understand in order to work together. Just like any other language, we have some common practice that help us understand each other. For instance, when developing HTML, we want to make sure any tags that open are also closed. 

### Understanding Github
1. What is Github doing? 
2. What is Github Pages doing?
3. What are we doing when we "merge" code?

#### Github Pages
1. What is happening when we turn on Github Pages?
2. When I view my site on Github Pages, what am I viewing?
