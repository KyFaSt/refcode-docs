# Sprint 1
For this sprint, we are going to build on our previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Github to start to create a Github page that we will contribute to throughout this course. 

## Review Previous Class Assignment
* Why are side projects so important for developers? 
  * Is this something unique to web development? 
  * Is this attitude different than what you expected?
* How would you describe "Thinking like a Programmer?"
* What was one web design trend you would like to try out?


### Making Time to Code
April is the CEO and Founder of Vogue & Code, an online resource for minorities in tech to explore the industry and find guidance on where to get started. Between running a business, working a full-time job, and various side-projects, she explains how she fits learning to code into her days in this video, [Making Time to Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q-HgZvZhtE)

Hereâ€™s what she recommended:
1. Create a detailed schedule and stick to it
2. Code before your other obligations start
3. Try to sneak coding into smaller windows of availability, like lunch breaks


## In-class Assignment
The goal of the in-class assignment is to bring clarity on using Markdown. We will also explore using Github to create pull requests and cover some best practices when developing code collaboratively.

### Understanding Markdown -> HTML and CSS
Markdown is not HTML, but it is a syntax that translates to HTML. You cannot just view `.md` files in the browser - there has to be a program to convert it into HTML that browsers can render. 

Let's try to convert the following markdown into HTML:

```
# Markdown Blog Post
I like using Markdown. It makes writing HTML so much easier!
**You can even use HTML in Markdown**, which is <em>really cool!</em>

I think I'll use it to format all of [my blog posts](../blog) from now on. However, I've discovered there are a few things to look out for.

## Things to look out for
* Markdown is really good when I don't need to worry about styles
* When you want to add styles, you have to build a new compiler :(
* It's easy to make some small changes that don't work out well, like: ![Screenshot of Markdown] (./images/screenshot-of-markdown.png) doesn't work because it has an extra space in it! 
* You have to have a special plug in to see what it's going to look like locally


Remember to checkout this [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) if you need help figuring out how to do something. It's really helpful!

1. What is Markdown? 
2. How does Markdown get converted?
3. What is Markdown good for? What are some times when it would be better to write HTML?
