# Sprint 1
For this sprint, we are going to build on our previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Github to start to create a Github page that we will contribute to throughout this course. 

## Review Previous Class Assignment
* Why are side projects so important for developers? 
  * Is this something unique to web development? 
  * Is this attitude different than what you expected?
* How would you describe "Thinking like a Programmer?"
* What was one web design trend you would like to try out?

## In-class Assignment
The goal of the in-class assignment is to bring clarity on using Github to create pull requests and cover some best practices when developing code collaboratively.

### Creating Pull Requests
For this assignment we are going to have students create a basic page on their projects repository as a new branch, then open a pull request for their changes. Next, we will pair up into groups where members will comment on each other's code. We will initially perform a code review face-to-face with one assigned reviewer, and then we will break for discussion.

#### Questions for Discussion
* What was helpful in the comment?
* How did you point out things that you wanted to ask about?  
* What suggestions did the reviewer give? 
* Did you agree with everything the reviewer said?

#### Takeaway
When developing on your own, you have total control on what goes into your project and how it is written. The code for your project only has to make sense to you! However, as soon as you have another person look at your code, you have make sure your code makes sense to others too. If your code is not understandable to other developers, then they won't be able to make good comments and help you out, and they also won't want to add your code to their project. Viewed this way, code is a language that everybody needs to understand in order to work together. Just like any other language, we have some common practice that help us understand each other. For instance, when developing HTML, we want to make sure any tags that open are also closed. 

### Understanding Github
1. What is Github doing? 
2. What is Github Pages doing?
3. What are we doing when we "merge" code?

#### Github Pages
1. What is happening when we turn on Github Pages?
2. When I view my site on Github Pages, what am I viewing?
