## In-class Assignment
An important part of being a professional software developer is the ability to communicate technically with others. Whether it is discussing new concepts with peers or discussing strategy with non-technical stakeholders, being able to clearly communicate technical matters is vital to professional growth. One of the best ways to practice technical communication is to keep a log of your developer journey and new things you have learned. As a bonus, a visible journey of your growth can be an invaluable tool when applying and interviewing for a development job. Employers look for employees that can show they are self-motivated and capable of professional growth. In the tech industry, you are expected to not only know your stuff, but also be able to show your work, so that's what we're going to be doing in this course!
