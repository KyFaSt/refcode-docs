## In-class Assignments

## At-home Assignments
Up to now, we've been using Github Desktop to manage our project repositories on Github, but we haven't dug into how git as a version control program works. Next session will will go into details about commits, best practices, how to contribute to other repositories via PRs, and how to give valuable comments. Being able to give useful and concise comments on a PR is a really good skill to have when looking for a job, and, just like everything else, it takes time and practice to master.

The at-home assignments this time are to help prepare for next week discussion and get you familiarized with git and Github:
