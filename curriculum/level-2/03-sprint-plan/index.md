## Let's talk about SASS

Sass is a CSS pre-processor. What is a pre-processor? Well it's code that we can write that is turned into CSS code - kind of like Markdown is turned into HTML! 

Why write Sass instead of css? Sass comes with a few super powers that help us write more maintainable css code. Features like variables, nesting, functions and more make it easier to manage our CSS as the number of styles grows large.

### 1. Install SASS

Navigate to https://sass-lang.com/install to install Sass on your computer. Looks for the **command line** instructions for Mac or Windows.

### 2. Running SASS

Sass is run using the command line. Run Sass by giving it an input `.scss` file and an`.css` file to create.

Example:

```
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
```

### Experimenting with Sass

In class experiments with Sass variables and nesting.
