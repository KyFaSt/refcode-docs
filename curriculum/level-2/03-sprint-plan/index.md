## Homework

Next week, we'll be setting up a platform called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build out our blog sites. Jekyll is a static site generator, but what does that mean? Read and watch the assignments below and be prepared to discuss what features Jekyll provides. In the next class we'll install Jekyll and its dependencies and set up your Jekyll blog.


**Assignments:**

- Watch this introduction to Jekyll: [https://youtu.be/T1itpPvFWHI](https://youtu.be/T1itpPvFWHI)
- Watch the setup instructions video for your computer. We'll do the setup next week in class together:
	- [Mac](https://youtu.be/WhrU9m82Wm8)
	- [Windows](https://youtu.be/LfP7Y9Ja6Qc)
- Look through the [Jekyll Showcase](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/). What kinds of sites can be built with Jekyll? What kinds of pages and features do these sites have?
