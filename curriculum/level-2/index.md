# Level 2 Course Overview
Refcode Level 2 is an introductory web development course for graduates of the [Level 1 course](../level-1). The objective of this class is to continue to build the skills taught in the Level 1 course with a focus on code quality and best practices. This class will also cover JavaScript, object oriented programming, command line Git, and the Chrome Developer tools.

## Course Goals
After completing this course, students should feel comfortable completing small to medium web development tasks with little to no guidance. Students will also gain a broader understanding of the technologies powering the web, allowing them to guide themselves forward in their developer journey.

## Classroom Structure
Students are initially introduced to new topics outside of the classroom and are provided online instructional content the week before the class. The classroom is used to explore topics in greater depth and create meaningful learning opportunities, building on the topics from the homework. The purpose of this approach is to provide more time in class on higher-order thinking skills such as problem-finding, collaboration, design and problem solving as students tackle difficult problems, work in groups, research, and construct knowledge with the help of teachers, TAs, and peers.

## Sprints
The curriculum is broken into sprints, each sprint being one week long. The lesson plans and homework for each sprint are adapted each week based on progress from the previous class and the students needs.
