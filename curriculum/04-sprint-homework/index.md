## Work on your Project
Remember, our website should have all of the following pages:
* Homepage (index.html)
* About page (mystory.html)
* Links page
* Resume page

On the home page, use the `<img>` tag to display the picture taken of you during class.

Your website should have a header (the name of your website) that is the same on all pages. This way we know we are on the same website as we change pages.

Your website should have a navigation section with a link to each page on your site.

The current page you are on should be visually different (e.g. bold or a different color)

If you haven't already, add the `reset.css` file to the `styles` folder of your repo.

Create a new file called `style.css` in the `styles` folder of your repo. **For the project site, we are only going to write CSS in this file from now on.** Link to it using `<link>` (see video above for help).

Begin to style your document using CSS in your `style.css` file. 

Reference your [website sketch](../../modules/using-css-to-style-html) to add elements, such as a header or sidebar, to your website.

Commit all changes to your repo and push your changes to GitHub.

## Self Learning
Spend some time learning on your own. You can use Google or YouTube or anything else that will help you learn. Try exploring a topic on HTML or CSS that you can share with the class!
