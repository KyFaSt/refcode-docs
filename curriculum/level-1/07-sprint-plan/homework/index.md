# Sprint 7 Homework

## 1. Send Slack Message
Send a message “Hello, I am starting my homework!” to the `#general` room on Slack.  Remember to ask for help if you are getting stuck.

## 2. Continue to work on your project
1. Make sure you have a header, footer, and navigation across all your pages
2. If you haven't already, post your project site link to the `#project-website-links` channel
3. Make sure your `links.html` page is up-to-date so it has links to other classmate's sites.

### Project requirements
* Style your document using CSS in your `style.css` file.
* Add javascript to your page using the `script` tag to import a `scripts.js` file.

## 3. Exercises
1. Continue to work on the in-class workshop and make sure it's added to your site in the `labs` directory.
1. Create an `index.html` file for your `labs` directory with links to your projects pages. 
1. Find another website that you think is cool and share it with your study group. *What do you like about the site? What are somethings you would do differently?*
1. BONUS: Create another page in your `labs` directory and try to recreate the page you selected. *How far can you get? Where did you have the most difficulty?*

> Remember to ask your Study Group Leads for help! Learning to code is hard and takes time. You won't be able to get it all at once, but that's what Slack is for - to ask questions. 


## 4. Self Learning
Review some Javascript or CSS Grid topics! Share in your study groups things that you've learned - and feel free to share in class too!
