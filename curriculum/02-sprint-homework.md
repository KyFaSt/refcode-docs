## Project
1. Register a domain name

1. Create your website home page
 - In Atom, create a file named index.html. Make sure it’s inside your project folder.
 - Type the name of your domain (similar to how x.com did).
1. Create your website “developer story” page
 - Use Atom to create a file named mystory.html. Make sure it’s inside your project folder.
 - Copy your developer story outline (from the shared Google Doc here).
 - Paste your developer story into the mystory.html file in Atom.
 - Consider if there are any major milestones missing from the list you put together.
 - Use HTML to turn your developer story milestones into a list (use the <ol> and <li> tags).
 - Use HTML to continue building your developer story page. It will need a heading and a paragraph to introduce yourself and to introduce the developer story. Feel free to add anything else you are learning about HTML
